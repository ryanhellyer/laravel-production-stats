# Laravel Production Stats

Production-ready performance monitoring for Laravel applications. Automatically injects performance statistics as HTML comments—lightweight, secure, and production-safe.

For years I've added basic performance stats to WordPress sites as HTML comments in the footer. They're always available in the HTML source, don't bother users, and help determine if a site is cached and how quickly pages generate. **When I moved to Laravel, I missed this functionality** and kept manually adding stats to templates. This package automates that process.

**Note:** While this package injects into your pages, is typically not sensitive information, you shouldn't use this package if you don't want site visitors being able to see this data.

## Features

- **Automatic tracking** - Measures page load time and generation timestamp
- **Production-ready** - Unlike development-only tools, safe for production use
- **Non-intrusive** - Injects as HTML comments, invisible to end users
- **Safe** - Only processes HTML responses, won't break JSON/XML
- **Zero configuration** - Works immediately after installation

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 10, 11, or 12

## Installation

```bash
composer require ryanhellyer/laravel-production-stats
```

## Usage

No configuration needed. The package automatically tracks page load times and generation timestamps, injecting them as HTML comments before the closing `</body>` tag.

### Example Output

```html
<!-- Page generated in 42 ms at 2025-12-12 14:43:42 -->
</body>
```

View in your browser's page source.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
composer test
```

## What Gets Tracked

- **Page load time** - Time to render from Laravel bootstrap to response (milliseconds)
- **Generation timestamp** - When the page was generated
